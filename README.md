# McDuff Cipher

So named because I don't know if it has a name already or not.

The cipher was made for a [Siren RPG](https://github.com/ElectricCoffee/SirenRPG) campaign called A Murder at Charlotte's Haven.

This repository features a bit of code that enables encoding and decoding of the cipher.
